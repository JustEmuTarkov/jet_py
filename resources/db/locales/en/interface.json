The area is sealed off, and your operational command is not responding; former mission objectives have lost their purpose. Everybody has personal goals now – adapt and survive, escape the blockade or try to save others.\n\nBe prepared to die and lose everything you had with you in every raid you enter.\nKeep in mind that every drop in your internet connection or network hardware malfunction can lead to disconnection from the game with the consecutive death of your character and loss of all the gear you had with you or found in within your raid.\n\nYes, you will die, and most probably, very often, but remember – this is still a game.
